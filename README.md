Code and data for the manuscript Multimodal communication in the greeting behaviour of African savannah elephants 

Many species communicate by combining signals of different sensory modalities. The functions of multimodal communication, however, remain unclear. Elephants live in multi-level social groups and possess a rich repertoire of signals across different sensory modalities. However, a systematic study of multimodal signalling has never been conducted in elephants. Here, we describe the greeting behaviour of semi-captive elephants (Loxodonta africana) to examine whether elephants produce socially directed gestures and how they combine gestures with vocalisations in multi-signal combinations. We show that elephants direct their body acts at recipients selecting their modality based on recipientsÂ´ visual attention, indicating evidence of first-order intentionality in elephant gesture. We further show that elephants produce specific multi-signal combinations. The most frequent combination was of rumble vocalisations with ear-flapping gestures, which was most frequently used between females. Our study expands upon our knowledge of elephant communication and advances our understanding of the evolution of multimodal communication.
